I believe that technology should enhance our natural abilities, not replace them. That's why I created **Orma** (ഓര്‍മ്മ, meaning "Memory" in Malayalam) – a revolutionary browser extension that transforms how you capture, understand, and interact with information online.

## A Magical Experience

Orma isn't just another note-taking tool. It's a beautifully crafted digital memory companion that works the way your brain does. Every interaction is thoughtfully designed to feel natural and effortless.

It empowers you and the LLM tools like ChatGPT or Claude you use everyday as well, by providing memories that are both meaningful and contextual.

## The Technology Behind the Magic

I've carefully chosen each piece of technology to create an experience that's both powerful and elegant:

- React 18 with TailwindCSS for a responsive, native-feeling interface
- Google Nano AI(Chrome Built-in AI) for lightning-fast processing
- Vector search for intelligent memory connections, powered by OpenAI Embeddings
- IndexedDB via Dexie for reliable, offline-capable storage acting as the powerful vector storage
